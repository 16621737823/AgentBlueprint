# AgentBlueprint
***
## What is AgentBlueprint
AgentBlueprint is a base framework that deeply connects between application code and LLM.
## What does AgentBlueprint have
AgentBlueprint has roughly 3 parts:
1. **Single Agent Blueprint**: A blueprint is a pre-defined structure of Data/Prompts that represents how the agent should behave in a controllable fashion.
2. **Data-Driven Structure**: The whole framework is data-driven, meaning that most of the data variable that might be used later in the LLM is pre-generated in the framework. This allows a frictionless connection between the application data and the LLM.
3. **Multi-Agent Support**: Because of the data-driven structure and self-determined nature of each agent, multi-agent support is a natural feature of the framework.
